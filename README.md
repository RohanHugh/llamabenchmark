Benchmark LLMs for Mobile
## Description
The main goal of llamabenchmark is to benchmark your device and see if you can run a llm locally. We use Android Studio, flutter and llama.cpp.
## Flutter
Flutter is an open-source framework that allows developers to build natively compiled applications for mobile.
### Why flutter?
- Hot reload: Flutters hot reload allows quick iterations and quick debugging
- Performance: Flutter apps are compiled to native machine code which allows for high performance
- Rich widget library: FLutter offers a lot of customisable widgets
